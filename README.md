# sml_exemplars
Standard ML functions that  are of interest

Sometimes, Standard ML makes certain things extremely trivial and intuitive. This
repository will be a collection of SML functions I have written to help other
students of computer science, or simply to collect elegant solutions to problems.

Right now, only insertion_sort is defined--I will add more later. Namely, an efficient regular
expression parser that does not require a DFA (in fact, it requires nothing more than recursion).

Feel free to send me an email if you are a student learning SML and need help.
